## Install PostgreSQL

### Mac OS X

1. The recommended way to install PostgreSQL in Mac OS X is using [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/). Follow the instructions on the website to install the software.
2. Once you installed the application, launch it and you should see a small elephant on your toolbar (see screenshot). ![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/jtestard/MAS-DSE-201-Support/master/images/postgres_app.png =600x200)
3. Click on "Open psql" and you are presented with an interactive shell you can use for SQL commands.
